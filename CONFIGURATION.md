# Configuration Guide

Detailed guide for configuring CI Plumber.

## Author Filtering

CI Plumber can be configured to only process PRs from specific authors (whitelist).

### Configuration

```yaml
authors:
  include_token_owner: true  # Auto-include GitHub token owner
  allowed_users:
    - "teammate1"
    - "teammate2"
```

### Behavior

**`include_token_owner: true`** (default)
- Automatically detects your GitHub username from the token
- Adds you to the allowed authors list
- Useful for personal automation

**`allowed_users`**
- Additional GitHub usernames to process
- Can be empty list if you only want your own PRs

### Examples

#### Only your PRs
```yaml
authors:
  include_token_owner: true
  allowed_users: []
```

#### Your PRs + teammates
```yaml
authors:
  include_token_owner: true
  allowed_users:
    - "john-doe"
    - "jane-smith"
```

#### Only specific users (not you)
```yaml
authors:
  include_token_owner: false
  allowed_users:
    - "team-lead"
```

**Note**: The `authors` section is **required**. CI Plumber will fail to start if it's missing.

## Approval Requirements

CI Plumber enforces strict approval requirements before merging:

### Configuration

```yaml
approvals:
  minimum_count: 2
```

### How it works

The system checks:

1. **Minimum approvals** (default: 2)
   - Must have at least 2 approvals from any reviewers

2. **Requested reviewers (users)**
   - If specific users are requested, they must approve

3. **Requested teams**
   - If a team is requested (e.g., @backend-team), at least one member must approve
   - System checks team membership via GitHub API

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Insufficient approvals
```
Current: 1 approval
Required: 2 approvals
Output: ‚ùå PR #123 needs 1 more approval(s) (current: 1/2)
```

#### Scenario 2: Missing team approval
```
Current: 2 approvals (alice, bob)
Requested: @backend-team
Team members: charlie, dave, eve
Output: ‚è≥ PR #123 has 2/2 approvals but missing requested reviews:
        üè¢ Missing team approvals: @backend-team
```

#### Scenario 3: Missing specific user
```
Current: 2 approvals (alice, bob)
Requested: charlie
Output: ‚è≥ PR #123 has 2/2 approvals but missing requested reviews:
        üë§ Missing user approvals: @charlie
```

#### Scenario 4: Ready to merge
```
Current: 2 approvals (alice, bob)
Requested: @backend-team
Team member bob approved ‚úì
Output: ‚úÖ PR #123 is ready to merge
```

## Label Management

CI Plumber supports two types of label management:

### 1. Simple Auto-Add Labels

Labels that are always added if missing:

```yaml
labels:
  auto_add:
    - "workdays: Mon-Fri"
    - "priority: medium"
```

These labels will be added to any PR that doesn't have them.

### 2. Category-Based Labels

Labels with prefix-based logic - only adds default if no label with that prefix exists:

```yaml
labels:
  categories:
    - prefix: "Monoreason:"
      default: "Monoreason: Large effort"
    - prefix: "Team:"
      default: "Team: General"
```

**How it works:**
- If PR has **no** label starting with `Monoreason:` ‚Üí adds `Monoreason: Large effort`
- If PR already has `Monoreason: Small effort` ‚Üí **skips**, leaves existing label
- If PR already has `Monoreason: Medium effort` ‚Üí **skips**, leaves existing label

This allows developers to set their own Monoreason but ensures there's always one present.

## Complete Configuration Example

```yaml
github:
  token: "ghp_yourtoken..."
  repo: "Dapulse/dapulse"

authors:
  include_token_owner: true
  allowed_users:
    - "teammate1"

labels:
  trigger: "ci-plumber-to-merge"

  auto_add:
    - "workdays: Mon-Fri"
    - "automated"

  categories:
    - prefix: "Monoreason"
      default: "Monoreason: Large effort"
    - prefix: "Priority"
      default: "Priority: Medium"
    - prefix: "Team"
      default: "Team: Platform"

repository:
  local_path: "/tmp/dapulse"
  max_commits_behind: 100

approvals:
  minimum_count: 2

linter:
  fix_command: "npm run eslint:changed:master"

logging:
  level: "INFO"
  directory: "logs"
```

## Use Cases

### Example 1: Developer sets their own Monoreason
```
PR labels: ["ci-plumber-to-merge", "Monoreason: Small effort"]
Result: Adds "workdays: Mon-Fri" only
Action: Skips Monoreason (already has one)
```

### Example 2: No Monoreason set
```
PR labels: ["ci-plumber-to-merge"]
Result: Adds "workdays: Mon-Fri" AND "Monoreason: Large effort"
Action: Adds default Monoreason
```

### Example 3: Multiple categories
```
PR labels: ["ci-plumber-to-merge", "Team: Backend"]
Result: Adds "workdays: Mon-Fri", "Monoreason: Large effort"
Action: Adds default Monoreason, skips Team (already has one)
```

## Adding New Label Categories

To add a new label category:

1. Edit `cfg/config.yaml`
2. Add to `categories` list:
   ```yaml
   - prefix: "YourCategory:"
     default: "YourCategory: Default Value"
   ```
3. Restart the service or run manually

No code changes needed!
